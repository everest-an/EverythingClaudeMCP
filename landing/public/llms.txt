# AwesomeContext

> AwesomeContext is an open-source MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives Claude Code instant access to 122+ engineering rules — architecture patterns, security checklists, coding standards, and compliance checks. Sub-5ms retrieval with 96% token savings.

## What it does

AwesomeContext provides four MCP tools that Claude Code calls automatically during development:

1. **get_rules** — Loads project-specific coding standards at the start of every conversation. Detects the project's tech stack (Python, TypeScript, React, Go, etc.) and returns the most relevant rules.

2. **architect_consult** — Returns architecture patterns and design principles before writing code. Covers REST API design, authentication, microservices, database schema, and more.

3. **skill_injector** — Loads complete skill modules on demand. 40+ skills including security review, TDD workflow, Docker patterns, database migrations, API design, and code review.

4. **compliance_verify** — Checks code against loaded rules before committing. Catches SQL injection, XSS, anti-patterns, and OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities.

## Key metrics

- 122+ pre-built engineering rule modules
- Sub-5ms semantic retrieval per query
- 96% token savings compared to raw documentation in prompts
- 40+ injectable skills across all major development areas

## Quick start (cloud — recommended)

1. Sign up at https://awesomecontext.awareness.market/login and get a free API key from the dashboard.
2. Add to Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awesome-context": {
      "url": "https://awesomecontext.awareness.market/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick start (self-hosted)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/everest-an/AwesomeContext.git
cd AwesomeContext
docker compose --profile cloud up -d
```

Then configure Claude Code to point to `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.

## FAQ

Q: Does AwesomeContext work with Claude Code?
A: Yes. AwesomeContext is built specifically as an MCP server for Claude Code. Add the server URL to your Claude Code settings and Claude will automatically call the tools during development.

Q: Is it free?
A: Yes. AwesomeContext is open source under the MIT license. The cloud version at awesomecontext.awareness.market is free to use — sign up to get your API key.

Q: What programming languages and frameworks does it support?
A: AwesomeContext has rules for Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, React, Next.js, Django, FastAPI, and more. It detects your project's tech stack automatically.

Q: Can I add my own rules?
A: Yes. Self-host with Docker and drop markdown files into the vendor/ directory. Rebuild to add your own engineering rules and skills.

Q: How fast is it?
A: Under 5 milliseconds per query. Rules are pre-indexed using semantic embeddings for instant retrieval.
